            be able to share something so close to my heart with you all. Every

          <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            Someday, our world will become a place of endless love and peace.

            I believe that every single person on this planet has an amazing
            story and journey that has shaped who they are today. While we are
            on our personal journeys, we develop this incredible ability to
            connect more deeply to the world around us. This is what led me to
            founding Rouse Yoga and what drives me to do what I do every day.

            I strive to be the best version of myself I possibly can, I connect
            to that power deep within me to experience life at its fullest, I
            live my life craving to connect to the people and world around me, I
            am fearless in going after what I want and I am a fighter for the
            things that matter. And what matters to me is{" "}

            I want you to discover your power and connect to yourself deeply, so
            that you have no choice but to give yourself everything you want.
            And in that, I created Rouse Yoga, a platform of expression,
            community, love, power and self-discovery. We donâ€™t just teach yoga,
            we help you find power, understanding and purpose in your every
